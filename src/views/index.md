在经济全球化的影响下，多文字设计很早就在商业领域开始了尝试。从单纯为企业设计多语言的品牌标识，到如今初露锋芒的本地化字库定制，这通常是较大的设计公司、字体公司承接的业务，也尽在有限的范围内运用。如今随着小型工作室、独立设计师的涌现，多文字设计则成为一种共同的专业追求，这意味着更多人将在跨文化的语境下设计，即为非母语的文字做设计。  
As our world becomes increasingly globalised, businesses have begun experimenting with multiscript design for quite some time. From the early days of basic requirements like increasing international brand awareness to the burgeoning demand for localised custom typefaces, such work was considered niche and usually undertaken by relatively larger and established design firms or type foundries. These days, the growth of small foundries and independent designers has made multiscript design more mainstream. With a lot more designers working in multilingual contexts and designing for scripts that are not native to themselves.

这一潮流先前主要由欧美引导。毕竟无论在铅字印刷时代还是桌面排版时代，欧美都是最早提供生产工具和资料的一方，以至于「多文字设计」在西方语境中，几乎等同于「非拉丁文字设计」之义，而且拉丁文字设计的理念也主导了其他文字的设计。经过了几十年，这一平衡被逐渐打破：「其他文化」开始发出自己的声音，反观自身的文字和书写传统，重构起本土的美学认知，阿拉伯文字体设计的崛起就是一例。而在数字时代，各文字特有的书写排印规则也成为国际标准、设计工具必须考量的因素，本土性正成为全球性设计的有机部分。
This trend started in Europe and the Americas, who were at the forefront of producing resources and tools during the era of moveable type printing, as well as the era of desktop publishing. A consequence of that is we end up associating multiscript design with non-Latin type design, and it is obvious how extensive the influence Latin type design principles have had on other scripts.  
In recent decades, however, such notions are being upended. So-called “other cultures” are starting to make their voices heard in the typographic world, designing typefaces that reflect the true nature of their language and writing traditions. Arabic type design is one great example of this. In the digital age, the unique requirements of different scripts are becoming standardised and something our design tools need to take into account, as locality becomes a contributing part of global design.

那么中文设计师呢？一方面，在全球化经济下，中文设计师其实有许多设计或应用多文字字体的机会，却因种种原因没有主动充分利用；反过来，西方设计师做中文字体设计也并不多见。但近年来我们依然看到了新的趋势：思源／Noto 泛中日韩字体家族的横空出世，给业内带来巨大冲击；蒙纳字库时隔多年推出全新中文黑体「翔鹤黑」，与之前的日文版 Tazugane 一同配合西文 Neue Frutiger，意欲相互打通，成为覆盖全球文字设计的超级字体组合；除了大厂商，西方独立设计师和工作室也开始关注中文设计，德国设计师罗小弟设计的「老外宋」和进行中的「港街黑」都毫不逊色于本土设计师……关于中文设计的讨论正逐渐进入国际的视野。  
But what about Chinese type designers? On one hand, in an increasingly globalised economy, Chinese designers have had numerous opportunities to design multilingual typefaces, but somehow these hardly came to fruition. Conversely, we also hardly see western designers working on Chinese typefaces. But things are changing in recent years. The release of the Source Han family of pan-CJK typefaces rocked the industry.  
Monotype also released a brand new Chinese Hei font, M XiangHe Hei, for the first time in years. Together with Japanese humanist sans serif, Tazugane Gothic, both these typefaces had been designed to complement Neue Frutiger, essentially becoming an international “super” font family.  
Besides the big boys of the type design industry, independent designers and foundries in the West have also started placing greater emphasis on Chinese type design. The work of German type designer, Roman Wilhelm, who created “Laowai Sung” and is currently working on “Hong Kong Street Face”, is more than on par with that of native Chinese designers. Discussion around Chinese type design has also begun to seep into the consciousness of the international design community.

这种转变所带来的一些疑惑、争鸣、探索、切磋，在我们看来是极为重要的。在中文世界，对跨文化设计的理论探讨尚未成气候，而在思考中形成自己的观点，在一定程度上也意味着对本文化设计加深理解，指导最终的设计实践。因此，我们在今年的不同时期邀请了关注多文字的设计师、研究者、以及 TIB 的多位作者，针对「跨文化语境下的文字设计」这一主题展开谈话，并整理成系列文章。希望借由公开的观点交流，激发更广泛的探讨。首篇中，我们将重点放在跨文化设计中的本土审美问题上。

The doubts, controversy, exploration and increased collaboration brought about by these changes are extremely significant. In the Chinese language domain, discussion and discourse around transcultural typography is still in its infancy. Ideas and perspectives around this are still being formulated as designers seek to further understand their own culture and design.  
This year, we will be inviting numerous type designers, researchers and TIB authors to discuss transcultural typography. The transcripts will be released as a series of articles. Our hope is that these open discussions can be the catalyst for further exploration of this topic. In this first article, we will be focusing on Chinese discourse around transcultural typography.

**谁能来做跨文化文字设计？**  
*Who should be doing transcultural type design?*

Peiran：在讨论母语／非母语者做文字设计时，我们或许可以区分「准不准做」和「能不能做好」。对于非母语设计师来说，「准不准做」是在判断在后殖民的语境下的道德正义性，是最低限度的尊重；而「能不能做好」则是在「准做」之后，推动设计、文化和语言上的创新。  
When discussing type design done by native versus non-native speakers, we need to make a distinction between who is allowed to do it, and who can do it well. For non-native designers, there is a need to take into consideration the post-colonial impact on the indigenous language and culture itself. And whether it's appropriate for non-native designers to do such work. If that's sorted, then we can talk about promoting innovation in designing for transcultural typography.

CP：就像之前大曲都市（Toshi Omagari）先生与我们讨论时提到的：母语者未必能设计母语的文字，同理，非母语者也未必不能做跨文化的设计，说不定还能做得更好。  
Just like Toshi Omagari mentioned in our previous discussions, native speakers don't necessarily have the skills to design for their native scripts, and conversely, it does not mean that non-native speakers are unable to do transcultural type design. They might even excel at it and do it better.

Roman：对我来说，设计陌生的字体是一种「接近」（Annäherung/approach）的过程，或者说「沉浸」（Vertiefung/immersion）的过程。如果我说，我必须独立地找到做这件事的方法，哪怕设计结果是这样（不够好）的，也完全没有问题。  
To me, designing foreign characters is a process of “Annäherung” (approach) or “Vertiefung” (immersion). If I had to discover and work out my own techniques independently, even if the end result is seen as “not good enough”, that's not a problem at all.

**「能不能做好」是指哪些审美上和方法上的要求？尝试设计其他文字的设计师，从道理上说需要作出怎样的努力？**  
*What sort of requirements in terms of both the aesthetics and techniques determine if transcultural type design “is done well”? In theory, what should designers looking to move in this direction look out for and work on?*

Tien-Min：当文字作为一种图像创作时，对于可读性以及是否符合母语者的习惯，或许不需要太严格，因为它不是以功能导向的。但是当文字设计作为一种「产品」时（字体设计），则应该以使用者为第一考量，因为字体设计的目的是阅读，审美标准当以阅读者为主（即能够阅读该文字者，一般为母语者）。难以阅读的字体就像一张不符合人体工学的椅子一样坐得难受。  
If you approach type design as a form of illustration, then perhaps legibility and adhering to native readers' sensibilities can be seen as secondary, because such design is informed by function. But when you are designing a typeface for practical applications, your focus needs to be on the needs of the reader (and most readers would be native speakers of the language). Reading an illegible typeface is as uncomfortable as sitting in a chair that does not suit human proportions.

Xiyao：能不能做好，与设计师是否来自于这个文化圈不一定有关系，但与是否认识该文字，还是有一点关系的。  
Whether or not the designer is from a particular culture is not the main factor for whether they can do the job well. But knowledge and familiarity of the script and its characters does matter.

CP：你可能对这门语言不熟悉，但是对于文字造型、书写规律、排版方式必须要熟悉。即便如此，设计效果的接受度也见仁见智。比如大曲都市做的蒙文字体，天格思乍一看来觉得字母太高；而天格思作为本土设计师做的无衬线蒙文，也并非所有人都能接受。  
You could be unfamiliar with the language itself, but you must have a key understanding of its letterforms and characters, calligraphic and typographic rules. Even so, opinions on the end result could still be fairly polarised. For example, Tengis Khasbagana finds the letters in Toshi Omagari's Mongolian typeface too tall. But even as a Mongolian designer, Tengis's sans-serif Mongolian typeface may not be accepted by all Mongolian readers as well.

Peiran：字形是死的，人是活的。正如同词典的收词，以广泛流行的用法而不断更新一样，「能不能做好」其中好的标准，必然是以「母语使用者看起来自不自然、美不美观」为最终标准。比如美籍华人设计师 Juliet Shen 为美国原住民 Lushootseed 部落设计字体，花费了很长时间与部落沟通、了解他们的书写和沟通习惯，更特别提到「部落长老一致认为的字形写法与 Unicode 规范相反，此时就应该尊重部落长老的意思而非一味遵循 Unicode」。  
Fonts are dead, people are alive. Just like entries in the dictionary are constantly being updated as language usage evolves over time, “doing the job well” depends on whether native speakers find the typeface natural and aesthetically pleasing. In order to design a Lushootseed font, Juliet Shen spent a lot of time among the tribes, developing a deep understanding of the aesthetic traditions of their language and culture. What's significant to note is the fact that the tribal leaders unanimously agreed that if and when the the character's written style is in conflict with Unicode standards, then it is their opinions that should take precedence over a strict adherence to Unicode.

Chuyang：我觉得是否做得好的标准是不一定统一的。比如中日韩地区对汉字审美标准有相对统一的共识，但不代表这是永远的标准，或者绝对正确的标准，新的探索是没问题的。一些质量差的字体，你也没法不允许它出现，还是要看市场的反馈。我觉得出发点比较重要，如果是打着创新的名义来包装自己，那是不太好；但如果是为了尝试，哪怕水平不够或者观点不一样，但是去探讨尝试的方法、设计的概念等等，那也还行。  
I don't think there is a unified standard for what is considered “doing the job well”. For example, although the CJK regions have a relatively unified standard on the aesthetics of Han characters, they are not set in stone. There is nothing wrong with exploring something new. You can't prevent bad quality typefaces from being created. Much is dependent on market demand. I feel that intent is more important here. Simply applying the term “innovation” doesn't really mean anything. But if you're coming from a place of experimentation and curiosity, even if the end result is not as good as expected, that's totally acceptable.

Mira：放在今天看来，文字设计满足母语者需求似乎理所当然。但历史上跨文化的文字设计大多缘起于信息沟通不畅，也受制于此。比如十九世纪传教士在中国铸造金属拼合活字，是由于没有在当地文化中找到同等参照对象，从本国文化出发便成了唯一途径。现今，尽管信息交流不成问题，但我们还是能看到很多所谓「中国风格」的西文字体（比如外国中餐外卖常用字体风格 Chop Suey / Wonton），或者试图用西文理性化思路来制作的实验性的中文字体（比如 Ming Romantic）。这大概是群体审美去本位化的一个必经过程：从猎奇，到自以为然的模仿，再到开始真正了解。特别突出的个体可以跳过前两步，群体还是很难。  
In this day and age, it seems like a given for typefaces to fulfil the requirements of native speakers. But historically, transcultural typography came about from communication breakdowns, and were limited by this. For example, the Christian missionaries of the 19th century casted divisive types in China because there was no local equivalent they could use as a reference. They were simply using what was familiar to them as a starting point.  
Even today, when exchange of information between cultures is much smoother, we still see a lot of so-called “Chinese-style” Latin typefaces (like Chop Suey or Wonton, which were popularised by Chinese take-out chains). There are also numerous instances of experimental Chinese typefaces designed with the principles of Latin-based typography (like Ming Romantic).  
This might be an inevitable process of localising the aesthetic perceptions of the masses, from indiscriminately absorbing anything and everything, then moving on to pure mimicry and finally a true understanding. An individual might be able to directly reach a true understanding, but in terms of the overall masses, that's quite a challenge.

Roman：我们没有方法去全面地控制比较美学，但我们有机会因个人的理由或者某个事件而催生出借用设计来探讨跨文化美学的需求或向往，不管是一个工作项目还是个人缘由（遇到了什么人，去了什么地方，想要深入或了解某种语言文化等等）。如果这种原始欲望足够强烈持久，那么我们就有了接受记录所有外界信息的准备。「这个好丑，那个好看！」——为什么？其他人又怎么说呢？只有不断尝试理解文化动机、个人观点，才能积累起意识，从根本上真正捕捉到「外国」视觉文化的方方面面。无知就是连问题都不问。  
We have no means to fully monitor comparative aesthetics. What we do have, however, is an individual reason or event kickstarting the need or desire to try to enter transcultural aesthetics by design, be it a job assignment or a personal cause (people we met, places we went to, languages and cultures we wish to immerse in or understand). If that initial impulse is strong enough to sustain, then we start to be ready to record whatever we hear from others. “This is so ugly, but that looks nice!” – why does it? And what do others say? Only by constantly trying to understand the cultural motives of individual opinion can we collect the awareness needed to rudimentarily grasp the true dimensions of a “foreign” visual culture. Ignorance is when you don’t ask in the first place.

**文字设计审美的相对性体现在哪里，例如在不同语境下的审美差异？这与强调母语者审美是否矛盾？**  
*Different languages would have varying standards on what constitutes beauty in type design. Where do you think such differences are manifested? Would this conflict with the aesthetic sensibilities of native speakers?*

Chuyang：比如阿拉伯文的「中国风格体」（一系列融入了中国书法意趣、在中国发展出来的阿拉伯书法的书体），在中国有一千多年历史，但即使现在把它们放回阿拉伯世界，当地人看来依然觉得这是个彻头彻脑的怪胎。  
Take the example of the “Sini” style of Arabic script (Chinese-style Arabic calligraphy which developed in China), which has had thousands of years of history, but when you introduce such characters to native Arabic speakers, they would still find them odd and unnatural.

Xiyao：不止是中国体，稍微现代一点的阿文在他们很多人眼里看起来依然很怪。  
It is not just Chinese-influenced styles, the more modern Arabic characters also come across as odd to many native speakers as well.

Chuyang：但在中国，回民就觉得没有问题。再比如黎巴嫩设计师 Nadine Chahine 之前给蒙纳公司设计的 Frutiger Arabic，也是毁誉参半，你很难说这样极度现代化的设计是对还是错。像阿文这样在多地区使用的文字，就会存在这种问题，印度人觉得这样好看，迪拜人却觉得那样好看；而汉字的审美就相对单一，基本是中国人和日本人说了算。假设以后有更广泛、与我们本土不一样的认知，我也觉得没有必要扭转，这是审美自由。  
But in China, the Hui people do not see this as an issue. For example, even Lebanese designer, Nadine Chahine, designed Frutiger Arabic for Monotype is of two-minds about this issue. It is impossible to say whether a modernised design is right or wrong. Given how widespread the Arabic script is, such problems are inevitable.  
People from India may find a certain style pleasing, but people in Dubai may prefer another. The aesthetics of Han characters, however, are relatively unified. As long as the Chinese and Japanese approve, that's good enough. Even if there are divergences in opinion in future, I think that's fine as well. People are free to apply their own standards of beauty.

Peiran：把母语使用者放在最高的位置，与文字设计实验和创新并不矛盾。任何使用者的群体对于文字和字体的审美和实用取向，不可能永远是一潭死水。从大体上来看，字体使用者和创作者在美学上是互相影响、相互交融的。字体设计和文字排版的实验与创新，应当努力与大众的审美趣味保持同步，乃至于开创新的美学方向。  
Putting the views of native speakers as a priority is not in conflict with innovation and experimentation in type design. Any user group would have their views on the aesthetics and usage of a typeface, and those views can be fluid. In general, users and creators of typefaces exert an influence on each other in terms of aesthetics. Innovation and experimentation in typeface design and typography should be in-line with the aesthetic sensibilities of the larger group, which will inform the direction of such developments.

**反观自身，我们对母语文字的审美是如何形成的？**  
*Conversely, how do we judge the aesthetics of our native scripts?*

Chuyang：习惯还是很重要的。小时候怎么练字的，每一天看到周围环境中的字是什么样的，都会影响到对文字造型的概念。看似很经验主义，但毕竟连书法理论也不是一开始就有的，是后人在书法作品中总结出来的。  
Familiarity is still of utmost importance. Our opinions of typefaces are shaped by the way we learned to write as children through penmanship practice, the words we observe in our daily surroundings. This might feel very subjective, but even principles of calligraphy did not exist right from the start. They were developed from existing works which people found aesthetically pleasing.

Tien-Min：对于习惯以及练字，我的理解是：了解笔顺构成的无形连结、每个部件自身的意义、以及部件之间的主从关系（谁重谁轻、谁进谁让）。汉字的审美不仅仅是数学上的比例分割而已。我们对于每个单一汉字的结构分布的习惯，包含着我们对该字意义的理解，影响着我们对汉字的审美判断。例如写「計」的时候，我们习惯把「言」字边写得比「十」字窄，即使它的结构更为复杂，我们并没有给他更大的空间，那是因为「言」是偏旁。有时候看到非母语者的汉字设计比例不协调，那是因为他们少了这样的理解，单纯地以数理美学作为判断标准，让线条（笔画）在一个画面（汉字）中做结构分割。但如果我们把这样的设计上下巅倒过来看时，比例失衡的感觉反而消失了。那是因为倒过来看时，我们不再将汉字视为一个字，而是更像是一张图。我想非母语者所见的汉字可能更接近这样的感觉。  
As for my understanding of familiarity and penmanship practice. Understanding the invisible links formed by each stroke in a character, the meaning of each part of the character and the relationship between them (the interplay between heavy and lighter strokes, which parts should be the focus versus which should fade into the background). The aesthetics of Han characters is not determined by just mathematical ratios. Each and every character has their own unique constituent parts, which encompass the meaning of the word itself, and this impacts how we judge its beauty.  
For example, the character, “計”. The “言” portion of the character is written much narrower than the “十” portion. Even though “言” is more complicated, we do not give it more space, because it is a left radical. Designers without an understanding of the nature of Han characters, who design based purely on mathematical proportions may end up creating characters that look distorted to native speakers.  
What's interesting is that if you turn that same character upside-down, the sense of distortion disappears, because then we are no longer looking at it as a word, but instead as a picture. I suppose for non-native designers, they see Han characters more as pictures.

Xiyao：而且审美不是一个个人问题，是一个集体问题。  
We cannot view aesthetics from the perspective of individuals. It is a collective viewpoint.

CP：这是个动态的形成过程，并且因人而异。比如一个亚洲设计师到西方去留学，接触了很多现代字体，他的审美可能就会与他的同胞们不一样。而他喜欢的字体能否被广泛使用，可能与这个人的工作、所在的政治经济环境的支持也有关系，说不定他归国后成了文化部长，一声令下必须得用这个字体，那就影响到了公众审美。  
This is a dynamic process and not because of any specific human intervention. If an Asian designer furthers their studies in the West, and are exposed to a wide variety of modern typefaces, their aesthetic sense might be rather different from their peers back home. And whether the typefaces they prefer can be widely used is also dependent on the work they take up, and the type of support they receive from the environment around them. Perhaps they become the Minister of Culture upon returning home, and with a single decree mandating the use of a specific typeface, cause a shift in public perception.

Peiran：中国的字体排印发展史带有国情特色，包括但不限于：1）字符集的巨大，导致 2）生产资料不同——我们长期使用雕版而非活字，进而导致了 3）劳动组织结构不同，西方活字印刷迅速进入劳动细化分工，从字冲雕刻师到校对工，不一而足，而中国雕版印刷的主要劳动仍集中于写工、刻工，明清时期更是重点集中在刻工手里；4）「写工」这一职位，长期影响了大众审美，在西方进入机械铸字时代、开始评判活字字形设计优劣时，中国对印刷品的鉴赏，除了纸张、装订、印刷质量等生产因素外，就是写工／刻工的手笔好坏了，而「手笔」则受到书法审美标准的强烈影响。即便明清以降有所谓「馆阁体」和其他形体特征高度规律化的宋朝体，其本质上还是生产力发展与维持书法审美需求之间的调和；而在西方传教士研究拼合活字、传入电镀铸模技术时，中文字体的好坏依然受到书法审美的影响，哪怕是拼合活字，也有法国汉学家「不懂书法惯例」做字歪七扭八、而戴尔（Samuel Dyer）「尊重书法惯例」的整字铸造更为优雅的高下之分。因此中文字体与书法形态之间是紧密耦合的（coupled）。  
The history and development of typography in China is intertwined with Chinese history, language and culture. The vast quantity of Chinese glyphs resulted in a distinctly different approach when it came to printing. Woodblock printing was much more efficient compared to moveable type. This inadvertently led to a divergence in division of labour for printing work.  
Methods of production in the West quickly moved toward specialisation, from punch-cutting to proof-reading, hardly anyone did all the work by themselves. In China however, the focus was on calligraphy and woodblock carving, especially so during the Ming and Qing dynasties. The calligraphers influenced public perception of the aesthetics of Chinese characters.  
As the process of typecasting became mechanised in the West, people started to pay more attention to the design of letterforms in moveable type. In China, the focus remained on the skill and artistic talent of the calligraphers and woodblock carvers. The aesthetics of woodblock printing remained tightly intertwined with calligraphy.  
Even the highly standardised styles like Guan Ge Ti and Imitation Song were a balance between further automation of the production process and traditional calligraphic aesthetics. As the West further adopted copper matrices electroplating and experimented with divisive types, Chinese characters were still being judged on calligraphic standards.  
The French Sinologists, who experimented with divisive types, were unfamiliar with calligraphic practices, resulting in characters that were not in proportion and unnatural to the native speakers' eyes. Samuel Dyer, who had a much better understanding, punch-cut characters that were much more elegant. As such, we can see that Chinese characters and calligraphy are very tightly coupled.

Mira：沛然说的这一点很关键。中文字符集大的问题，许多西方同业者只看到它在现代设计生产中的阻碍，觉得这是工作量的问题，觉得如果用软件穷举了笔画部件的组合、用机器学习来优化流程之后，问题就能解决。但工作量问题事实上导致了中国印刷业早期的生产方式，并已然影响了文字造型的构建方法和长期的审美习惯。  
Peiran raised a very crucial point here. Many of our Western counterparts see the issue of Chinese language having a vast quantity of glyphs as a labour and effort problem. And such an issue can be resolved with the help of modern software, which can automate the combination of radicals into glyphs, thus optimising the design process.  
But the fact is, it was exactly this nature of the Chinese language that shaped the development of Chinese printing, and influenced our perceptions on the aesthetics of Chinese characters.

Roman：我想在这里补充说明一点：以技术为基础的中文字体开发也不完全是西方在做的事，否则只能得出创造性科技是西方理念、艺术造诣则属于中国人这样的定义。我认为中国设计师也是在数字环境中运用科技来处理完成工作。也不能认为数字环境就比实体世界的美学理想低一等，这只会导向另一种不同的审美观念，而西方并不崇尚和鼓励这种观念。  
I would like to add here that technology-based development of Chinese type should not be fully credited to the West – that would only lead to a definition of creative technology as a mere Western idea, while leaving the full artistic credit to the Chinese. Let me say that Chinese designers use technology to progress and to get things done in a digital context, and that this digital context should not be regarded as inferior to aesthetic ideals from the analogue world. It only leads us to different aesthetic values, and these are neither encouraged, brought forward nor awarded by the West.

**大家提到了书法与汉字设计的关联，此外在阿拉伯文、天城文、蒙文、藏文等文字中，传统书法也都对字体设计有着强烈影响，并且现代文字设计都没有跳脱这一框架。这会是一种创新的滞碍吗？**  
*We have touched upon the significance of calligraphy on the design of Han characters, but this seems to be the case for other scripts like Arabic, Devanagari, Mongolian, Tibetan and so on. Do you think this is an impediment to innovation in typeface design?*

CP：中国书法历史丰富多彩，其流变和分支远多于西文书法，形态变化也更为夸张。到了清代，书法发展有所暗淡，到现在已经处于停滞状态。但是对字体设计来说，它仍然是一个未被打开的宝藏，这方面有巨大的发展空间，那么多历代的书法风格没有被完全转换成字体，它们之间还可以发生很多奇妙的化学作用。很多平面设计师都在想草书和宋体的结合，其实也是受到日文假名的影响。  
Chinese calligraphy has had a long and colourful history, evolving and branching off into different styles much more than calligraphy in the West. During the Qing dynasty, calligraphy hit a dark age, and has seemingly stagnated until today. But from the perspective for typeface design, it is a treasure trove of inspiration. There is a lot of room for development as numerous historical calligraphic styles have yet to be converted into typefaces. Many graphic designers are trying to combine Rapid script with SongTi, probably due to influence from Japanese katakana characters.

Peiran：我们对宋、黑、仿、楷的分类，与我们对西文字体风格的分类（比如 Neo-Grotesk 和 Humanist Sans）是不一样的。前者不仅有形态上的不同，也有着历史语境和文化背景上的微妙差异。与之相反，拉丁文字的书法特性与印刷字体之间的关系，在字冲雕刻师成为一个专门职业的那一刻，就已开始去耦合了（decoupled），Neo-Grotesk 和 Humanist Sans 不过是同一基本形态上的不同轮廓而已。基于这样的历史背景，若要抛弃书法规律则是罔顾国情的妄想，更隐约指向「落后的文化需要被拯救」这样的东方情结，需要警惕。  
Our classification styles of Song, Hei, Fang and Kai are very different from that of the West, e.g. Neo-Grotesk and Humanist Sans. Chinese character styles not only have a different morphology, but they are also deeply influenced by the history and culture during the time in which they were developed.  
Conversely, the calligraphic nature of Latin scripts were decoupled from printing the moment punch-cutting became a profession. Neo-Grotesk and Humanist Sans have the same core structure, in spite of their difference in profile.  
With such historical precedence, we should be cautious about abandoning calligraphic principles as this is akin to throwing away thousands of years of Chinese culture and history. And it also hints of the dystopian view that we are an inferior culture in need of “saving”.

Mira：西文书法与字体的去耦合程度其实也并不深。毕竟欧洲「书法家」（calligrapher）的概念出现得相当晚，更多都是「抄写人员」（scribe）的概念，为追求誊抄效率，较早出现了统一、理性、有规律的书体；而中文书法则追求字形内在的独立风骨，兰亭集序里几十个「之」字形态各异，那才算大家手笔。西文书法的这种循规蹈矩，反而让它得以轻松地把接力棒交给活字印刷，最早的哥特体和罗马体活字，其设计都是直接复刻手写体，后面再怎么像 Romain du Roi 那样用理性化、几何化、建筑学的方式重构，都是在一个骨架上去描摹轮廓而已。从这点来看，西文书法传统也一样如影随形，却也并没有阻碍西方字体设计的发展创新。  
Latin calligraphy and typeface design aren't really as decoupled as we make them out to be. The idea of a calligrapher in Europe appeared rather late, most people involved in such work were referred to as scribes. In order to maximise efficiency of replicating texts, standardised styles of writing emerged early on. Chinese calligraphy emphasises the unique flair of each individual character. A character repeated in a piece of work is expected to look different at each appearance to exemplify the calligrapher’s mastery.  
The rules of Western calligraphy actually made it easier to transition to moveable type. The earliest Gothic and Roman types were direct replicas of engravings. Even the later styles like Romain du Roi, which are of a very rational, geometric and architectural design, are based on the same core structure. From this, we can see how Western calligraphic tradition has subtly informed typeface design, but this has not hindered innovation at all.

Peiran：在亚洲，尊重文字传统、同时又实验创新的绝佳例子，有如日本 Fontworks 当年的筑紫 Antique Gothic。作为一款黑体，它继承了内文明朝体的紧凑中宫和浓郁的书法韵味，同时把「喇叭口」这一普遍丑陋的形态扭转成新的设计特性，在「喇叭口黑体」这一类别上可谓开拓了一片新天地。  
In Asia, there is huge respect for traditional script styles, but at the same time, there are numerous examples of innovation in type design. For example, the Japanese foundry, Fontworks, released Antique Gothic as a HeiTi typeface.  
It inherited the style of Mincho typefaces, with its tight ZhongGong (中宫, which depicts the density of a Chinese character) and intense calligraphic flavour. It also managed to transform the issue of “flared ends (喇叭口)” that are so often the bane of HeiTi typefaces into a unique design feature, paving the way for even more refreshing design innovation in this space.

CP：上海印刷技术研究所的老设计师们看到筑紫明朝也都特别激动，他们当年也想过，据说宋七就是这样的设计思路。  
The original designers from the Shanghai Printing Technology Research Institute get especially emotional when they see the TsukuMin typeface. They too had such ideas in the past. Apparently, the “Song 7 (宋七)” typeface followed a similar design process.

Roman：无论在哪里、在哪个时期，书体演变总是出于实用的目的。阿卡德人为什么要把美丽的楔形文字转 90 度书写？因为抄写工需要不断加快速度，满足日益增长的记录需求，不是有人计划好的，而是随着自动发生。拉丁字母也是不断迁徙（和引入）技术的结果，所有的书写系统莫不如是。说中文字体汲取了书法灵感，那是老生常谈了，它固然是更易理解的一种说法，因为显而易见嘛。我记得有篇葡萄牙学者写的关于澳门城市文字的文章，在讲招牌文字的时候，一直把拉丁「排印」和中文「书法」区分开来。难道他没有考虑到这些店铺招牌中只有很少的一部分是真正手写的吗？它们大多都是选用数字字体、用电脑和绘图机制作出来的呀。这种误解根深蒂固，而许多中国人自己也在助长这种对中国书法的迷思，这么做也无可厚非。不过有意思的问题从这里才刚刚开始：要学哪种书法风格呢？它属于哪个流派，源于什么文学艺术的背景呢？它援引了什么，或者做出了什么解答，或者它是对援引之物的解答？这才是文化争辩开始的地方，从这里我们才能真正了解到视觉文化以及其中的活跃分子。  
The evolvements of scripts were mainly of practical nature anywhere in the world – and through history. Why did the Akkadians rotate all of their beautiful Cuneiform characters by 90 degrees? Because the scribes had to work faster and faster, having to meet a steadily increasing need for written record. The rotation was never planned by anyone, it automatically happened through time. No writing system is more a result of migrated (and thus imported) technology than the Latin alphabet.  
It is no big deal to cite calligraphy as an inspiration for Chinese typefaces, of course it is. But it is, as an explanation, much easier to digest just because it sounds so obvious. I remember an article on urban typography in Macau written by a Portuguese scholar, that constantly distinguished between Latin “typography” and Chinese “calligraphy”, referring to shop signage.  
Didn’t he take into account that only very few of these shop signage was actually handmade? They had to come from somewhere, mainly digital typefaces rendered and produced using PCs and plotting machines. This misperception seems to be so deeply rooted, because many Chinese also nourish the calligraphic myth. It is fully all right to do so, but that is where things actually start to be interesting: which style? Which school, which literary or art context is it inspired from? Does it cite something, or is it the answer to something, or the answer to a citation? This is where cultural debate is setting off from. This is where we can really access to visual cultures and their living actors.

**历史上，外来文化对本国文字设计创新起到了怎样的作用？审美标准的差异如何在「新鲜感」、「实验」和「扭曲」之间找到平衡？**  
*What impact has foreign influence over history had on the design of Chinese typefaces? How can we find an aesthetic balance between innovation, experimentation and distortion?*

CP：我们的黑体字、圆体字就是从日本移植到中国，逐渐被广泛接受为正统字体的。这个背后有经济政治的原因，它超越了字体本身。好看与否是个人审美，但这个东西很潮、代表了国外先进的文化，裹挟着这样的信息就更容易被人接受。审美本身也是社会后期的文化规训的结果。民国时期，国内自主开发的字体主要以仿宋和楷体为主，黑体刚进入的时候仅仅作为标题，经历了一个逐渐被接受的过程，同时伴随着西方现代的商业、文化、意识形态的输入，使黑体具有了特定的用途和文化含义。  
Our HeiTi and YuanTi characters were introduced into China from Japan before achieving mainstream acceptance. There are economic and political reasons behind this that go beyond just the typefaces themselves. Whether something is seen as beautiful or not depends on individual tastes, and these tend to change with trends, of how foreign influence has impacted local culture. Such a concept seems to be easier for people to accept. Aesthetic perceptions are basically the products of socioculture disciplines.  
By the time the Republic of China was established, most of the typefaces were FangSong and KaiTi. The HeiTi typefaces were used mainly for titles at first, and took some time before being accepted for use as body copy. As the same time, the influence of Western culture also brought about more meaning and applications for the HeiTi typefaces.

Xiyao：近代的报业开始广泛使用黑体，这也让大众更多地接触、认识到了这种风格。  
Recently, the newspaper industry has also started to use HeiTi typefaces. This has increased the masses' exposure to such a style and improved its recognisability.

CP：九十年代圆体刚进入中国，本来不受待见，但由于日本经济文化的强力输入，导致很多人对日本产生好感，人们喜欢用圆体来印刷名片，显得洋气。当然这个过程中也会有进化，比如中国设计师在学习圆体字时融入了自己的设计想法。但终究这件事一定要和政治经济捆绑在一起才有广泛影响力。  
When the YuanTi typefaces first came to China, they were not well-received. But because of the strength of the Japanese economy, people's perception of Japan became more positive, and they started to use YuanTi typefaces for name cards as it came across as having foreign flavour. Of course these typefaces were not just adopted wholesale. Chinese designers learned and injected their own design thinking while coming up with their own YuanTi typefaces. Ultimately though, this entire process was closely intertwined with the economical and political situation at the time.

Mira：现在也有很多中国内地设计师都喜欢用日文汉字，或者港台的繁体字，而那些字形、笔画规范其实与本土的「书法传统」不同。如何解释这种异域情结的审美？  
A lot of Chinese designers like using Japanese Han characters, or the traditional Chinese characters from Hong Kong and Taiwan. The strokes of those characters, however, have diverged from calligraphic tradition. How can we explain such a tendency toward romanticising foreign aesthetic styles?

CP：我觉得这是因为很多非专业人士无法区别「字体风格」和「字形不同」这两者。很多人觉得港台字体好看，理由是它写法不一样，这里多一笔、那里少一笔，他以为这是一种风格，而不知道那是不同的字形规范，这其实是个严重的误区。但他们乐于接受这种风格，是因为这尚且在他们的书写经验之内，既认识，又有陌生感，就会吸引很多人去用。使用者的心态就是这样：我要跟你有所区别，但又不出错，你又能认识。  
I think such a trend arises from non-professionals being unable to discern between a difference in fonts and a difference in glyphs. A lot of people feel that the traditional Chinese characters from Hong Kong and Taiwan look nice because they are written differently. They have different strokes and people feel this is a stylistic difference, but don't understand that they are in fact, completely different glyphs. This is quite a serious misconception, but they are very accepting of such a style, because it is familiar to them, yet has an air of exoticism. Most users want to be unique and stand out, but still be recognised.

Mira：「在书写经验之内的陌生感」，这个描述让我想起罗小弟设计的「老外宋」，而它又让人想起传教士铸刻的形态略怪异的铅活字。大多数人认为后者不是美学典范，但前者却得到不少现代设计师的青睐。小弟你认为对<span class="checkme">异国文字的实验（或者说想像）与怪异之间的界限在哪里</span>？  
When you refer to a familiarity in writing yet with an air of exoticism, I cannot help but think of Roman's “Laowai Sung”. It reminds people of the early missionary style typefaces on the 19th century. Most people do not think highly of the aesthetics of those early style typefaces, but somehow “Laowai Sung” has garnered the favour of many modern designers. Roman, where do think <span class="doublecheck">the line is between experimentation based on non-local styles and a complete distortion of the character design</span>?

Roman：设计师固然可以自由地试验。相反的是，像马礼逊（Robert Morrison）那样的传教士则是有明确目标要实现的，然而也许是财力和意识形态差异导致他们缺乏当地专家的支持，那时他们设计、铸造和使用的活字字体并不像当时中国的其他印刷品那样完美。但我们又知道，马礼逊本人十分了解中国文化，认知敏锐，我们基本可以断定他也知道自己的铅字不入中国文人雅士之眼。直到姜别利（William Gamble）把铸字厂迁至上海，邀请了更有经验的本地工匠参与做字之后，一切才有改观。——设计「老外宋」时，我的角度也与之相似：我知道我自身的局限，但也非常了解中国字体设计与排印的美学要素。所以我干脆将自己欠佳的能力作为整个开发理念的起点——打个比喻的话，就是把森泽公司用手绘开发数字字体的方法倒过来。我从手稿开始就设定好原则，后期就不存在任何模糊的标准，一开始就有明确的实验设置，直接从结果开始想象。如果在做实验的过程中对结果没有清晰的概念，只是根据设置一步步做下去，很有可能会导致意想不到的、甚至不理想的结果。因此我感觉需要找到一种方式，真正实现想法，尽管有可能在过程中会导致一些设计的不一致性。——再说回马礼逊。当时在中国所有关于基督教的事情都是陌生的、新鲜的、也难以理解的，而马礼逊的目标也并不是受过教育的文人子弟，而是普通老百姓。奇怪的字体搭配奇怪的新思想，对于他要实现的目的来说，并没有什么不妥，他的印刷品也不必力求完美而附庸风雅。  
Designers are free to do anything. On the contrary, a missionary such as Robert Morrison had a clear goal to achieve. However, the moveable type designed, cast and used for his Chinese bible did not look exactly as perfect as contemporary printed matter available in China, and the reason may well be an inaccessibility to local experts due to financial and ideological differences.  
But we do know that Morrison himself was indeed a highly sensitive person with a broad understanding of Chinese culture, and we can well be sure he knew that the typefaces produced under him did not meet the aesthetic expectations of local literate elite. That only changed when William Gamble moved his type foundry later to Shanghai to invite better-prepared native artists to participate in the development — Laowai Sung was developed with a similar perspective.  
Knowing my own limitations, but being well aware of the aesthetic imperative in Chinese type design and typography, I set my own incapability as a starting point of the whole development — if I may say so, Morisawa’s hand-sketching approach in reverse. This being the principle I set to myself from scratch, no further ambiguities appeared at the later stages. Experiments have clear settings at the beginning, imagination starts at the result.  
While an experiment can be carried out following the settings with no clear end in mind, possibly leading to unexpected or disappointing results, a way has to be found in order to actually produce what you have imagined, possibly leading to inconsistencies on the way. But, to go back to Morrison for one more time. Everything regarding Christianity was then strange, new and not easy to grasp in China. On top of that, his target was not so much the well-educated local elite, but the common man. Strange-looking typefaces matched the strange new thought, and to his purpose, did not really mean much. His printed matter did not have to pretend to be well-rooted in Chinese literacy.

**在中文设计领域，无论是拉丁字母还是其他民族文字的设计，除了受到西方影响，我们自身对跨文化设计的意识和需求强烈吗？**  
*In the world of Chinese design, is there anything other than Western influences that inform our design of typefaces? Be it for Latin scripts or scripts from other cultures? Do we, as Chinese designers, have sufficient awareness and demand for transcultural design?*

CP：需求很小，所以几十年来主要字体厂商都用现成的西文字体拼配，就是因为需求不多，他也不觉得重要。少数民族文字种类更是寥寥。我觉得非官方文字的设计需求一定来自于商业，不可能来自于顶层的推动。  
The demand is very small, which explains why over the past couple of decades, type foundries tend match up type combinations with existing Western typefaces. It is simply not a priority. As for minority scripts, the demand is even smaller. I think for non-official scripts, the design requirements must come from commercial interests, and not something that is pushed forth by the authorities.

Roman：然而一些年轻的数字字体设计师通过一些项目表达他们的创作立场，比如蒙文字体之类的，也是在参与文化身份的一场辩论。  
However, young digital designers work on projects such as Mongolian typefaces to express their artistic positions, participate a debate on cultural identity, which is, again, political, especially in a country such as China.

Mira：除了个人表达之外，在更广泛的层面推动这种需求的动力在哪里？  
Aside from individual expression, is there a possibility of this being driven forward on a larger scale?

CP：我觉得就是经济全球化。国外的企业如果要进入中国，要匹配中文字体，而中国也开始有跨国企业有这样的需求。这些企业就会去找本地字库厂商，本地厂商再去找国外字库，例如方正和 TypeTogether 的合作就是如此。但这样的需求刚刚诞生。  
In our current globalised economy, foreign businesses are looking to enter the Chinese market and vice versa. This is causing a demand for matching Chinese typefaces with their existing branding. Businesses from China are also becoming more involved in international markets, thus also have similar demands. These corporations tend to engage local type foundries, and local type foundries in turn engage foreign type foundries. For example, this was how the collaboration between Founder Type and TypeTogether came about. But such requirements are just in their infancy.

Tien-Min：我也认为跨国商业是最大的推力。最近因为工作的关系，接触到一些跨国企业产品的品牌设计更新（rebranding）。基于中国是该产品的主要市场之一，客户不只希望能够中英文版本视觉一致，甚至希望能够在标准字概念发想时，就能同时进行中英文双版本，以避免做好英文版后，无法将视觉转换为中文。我认为标准字的需求应该会渐渐增长。至于中文字体设计目前无法形成大量需求的原因，可能还是因为字符量过大，订制成本高，仍然以现有字体匹配为主。  
I feel that international businesses will be the key driver for moving such work forward. I've been involved with the rebranding efforts for some international brands recently. Even though the target market is China, clients are looking for more than just a uniform visual style between Chinese and English letterforms. Ideally, they hope that both the Chinese and English designs are in sync from the start, avoiding the problem where the English design does not work at all when translated into Chinese. I think the demand for bilingual typefaces will grow. The issue remains that the large number of Chinese glyphs that need to be designed pushes up the production costs, hence as for now, we are still seeing combinations of existing typefaces instead of commissioned bilingual typefaces.

**跨文化设计的研究学习过程，非常需要前人对该文化的理性总结。而书法（尤其是中国书法）经验性的因素较多，至今中文字体设计仍难以有量化的、系统性的指南。这是否会局限它的对外传播和发展？**  
*The research process into transcultural type design requires input from our predecessors on the logical conclusions of their respective cultures. Calligraphy (especially Chinese calligraphy) has been impacted by numerous empirical factors, making it a challenge for Chinese typeface design to have some form of quantifiable and systematic direction moving forward. Would this impede its development and spread outside of China?*

Roman：在这个问题上，只有对语言和文化怀有真正的热忱才行。如果你学习一门语言，并且真的尝试用它来交流，那么自然而然就会遇到各种复杂的文化思考和争辩。我绝不是说一个创意人士说不了流利的外语就不能为其他文化做设计，但我知道的是，语言是接触该文化中思辨部分的关键。通过语言，才能最终把自己的方法放到一个多边的角度去看待，才能长期持续和沉浸于这种思辨。那时你就不是一个外人了。  
Here, only a true passion for language and culture will help. If you learn a language and really try to use it to communicate, a complex variety of cultural thought and discourse comes with it naturally. I would never say that a creative person would not be able to do designs for cultural contexts without fluently speaking their respective languages. But what I do know is that languages are crucial to accessing the respective cultural debate. By that, it is eventually possible to put one’s approaches into a multilateral perspective and to be able to sustain and immerse in that discourse. Only then you will not be an outsider.

Chuyang：汉字的结构比较复杂，不太能总结「有了 A 就有了 B，就有了 C 和 D」这样科学理性的规律。就像练书法一样，是先动手练，练出感觉了之后你自己会开始琢磨。即使总结出定律来了，学习成本也是巨大的，也许光学习就要学三年，那就没有效率上的意义了。现在的汉字设计看似没有系统理论，太经验主义，但是当下效率高。经验的传播范围可能的确有限，但可能所有传统艺术面临的是同样的问题吧，非常难以量化整理。  
The composition of Han characters is relatively more complex. We cannot use the typical sequential scientific method of having A, will lead the B, followed by C and D. It is rather similar to practicing caliigraphy, whereby you need to do the actual writing practice until you grasp the nuances of how it feels and what works. There is relatively steep learning curve, perhaps it would take 3 years simply just to pick up a good understanding. Such a lengthy timeframe negates any benefits derived from efficiency.  

Mira：你说的是传统艺术，但设计毕竟已经职业化了。不少设计师和开发者觉得，对汉字字形做量化研究，随后用软件把部首位置比例、笔画长短的可能性穷举之后，就可以节省基础工作的时间。  
You are referring to tradiontal Arts, but design has become a profession. Numerous designers and developers are of the opinion that performing extensive analysis on Han character forms to develop software that can assess and compose characters based on the proportions of radicals and their stroke lengths, thereby saving a lot of time on the fundamental work of producing large volumes of characters.

Xiyao：从经验到理性化设计的过程，虽然麻烦，但这个经验性的评判标准的确是有限的，有限的东西一定可以用理性语言去整理表达。不过，量化研究后的效果是什么，会不会是局限于单一审美标准的东西呢？节省工作时间，也是个很虚的概念，省掉的时间里，说不定能做出更多的尝试探索呢？  
It might hard to move from an empirical design style to a rational design style. There are limitations to empirical standards, and things with limits can be expressed in a rational language. However, would the result of a quantitative study end up being one-dimensional? A shortening of the production process may not necessarily be the best thing, who knows what innovations could have arisen from that explorative work done during that time?

Chuyang：这里还有个<span class="checkme">投入的问题</span>。一方面，如果一个字体厂商已经有五十个熟练工，三个月就能生产一套字库，厂商宁愿用现有的方法造字，这在商业上是成功的，而很少会愿意花额外精力去研究这套新系统。另一方面，技术能解决的事情很少，即使软件先把笔画全都帮你放到位，也没有节省多少时间。我计算过，把设计好的笔画自动复制粘贴、放置到字形里，一共就省四天时间。哪怕能省一个月，也没有什么意思嘛。  
There's also another issue here. If a type foundry already has 50 skilled staff who can produce an entire font within 3 months, then most businesses would rather stick with existing methods of producing typefaces, given this is a tried and tested process. Very few would be willing to venture into experimental research to develop new methods. On the other hand, technology only solves a narrow set of problems. Even if software can help with stroke placement, this does not really save that much time. I've done some calculations, forming characters from predesigned strokes saves about four days of effort. Even if you could save up to a month's effort, it does not really mean much.

CP：我觉得不一定只省那么点时间。这是一块未开垦的处女地，正因为没有理性化体系化，所以有人可以去做这个工作。理性化的过程，一定同时具有限制也具有创造性，但会在造字流程的效率上有所突破。  
I think this goes beyond simply saving time. This is blue ocean territory with plenty of room for exploration. It is precisely due to the lack of a defined systematic approach that allows anybody to take up such work. The process of rationalisation will have both limitations as well as opportunities for innovation, but will ultimately result in improvements in production efficiency.

Roman：研究只是为了更好地了解可能性，而不是就事论事。如果我要研究跨文化文字设计，那么了解比利时、瑞士、以色列，与了解中国一样重要。只有在你知道你在研究什么的时候，研究型设计才有益处，这里我要说到研究的深入性，话题决定了深度。如果话题是中国书法，好啊！但接下来问题就复杂了，比方说，如果你没有研究过古代中国书法家所在的社会，那就会失去方向，你得知道那个社会做事的方法、背后的原因、从中传递的意义，然后才能和其他国家地区类似社会作比较，得出可以让他人查证的结果。  
We’re doing research only to better understand what could be, rather than just what actually is. If I want to study multilingual typography, a look on Belgium or Switzerland or Israel can be just as important as one on China. Research-based design is good as long as you know what you are actually researching. And that leads me back to the profoundness of research, as much as a topic requires.  
If that topic is Chinese calligraphy, cool! But that’s where it starts to be more complex. For instance, you will get lost without studying the society calligraphers were part of in ancient China. You will have to understand how things were done in that society, and why, and what hidden meanings they communicated by them. Only then can you find comparisons to similar societies in other parts of the world, leading to results that can be examined and validated by others.

**从整个西方思潮进程来看，理性化／几何分析／抽象化／特征极端化／构成主义不仅是设计领域、也是整个艺术领域的发展方向。然而汉字之类的表意文字，能直接与表音文字的创新方式平行比照吗？这是否会陷入西方本位主义的局限？**  
From a Western perspective, there are geometric and radical (letterforms) that go beyond the realm of design, and have impacted the direction of the Arts in general. Can an ideographic writing system like Chinese achieve the same kind of innovation as writing systems which use phonograms? Or will we end up limited by Western centralisation?

CP：理性化系统化也许并不仅仅属于西方文明，逻辑思维是人区别于动物的一种能力。任何语言文字多少有一些既定规则，自带逻辑系统，只不过我们在设计的时候再次运行这个逻辑。我前面说的理性化只是造字过程的理性化，而不是设计的理性化，设计还是可以有很多创意的。  
Rationalism is not solely a concept that arose from Western civilisation, logical thinking is what differentiates man from animals. Every language will have their own rules and logical system of use, it is just that we have to run through their respective logic yet again during the design process. I'm referring to the rationalism when it comes to the typeface production process, and not the rationalism of design. There are a lot of room for innovation and creativity when it comes to design. 

Xiyao：现代性中的很多要素是和十六、十七世纪的很多国际因素相关的，如果要说是西方的东西，反而是一种西方中心主义。包括跨文化、本地化等词汇，虽然不是中文里原有的概念，是在西方概念上翻译过来，但不代表以前没有做过跨文化的事情，相反，跨文化的交往一直在发生。是否要把「他们」、「我们」的概念分得那么清楚，区分「异质性」，我不可置否。  


Peiran：汉字在一、二战期间，尤其是在上海，也经涌现过许多新艺术风格、装饰艺术风格的设计。联系上海的地理和经济重心，以及中国的殖民文化输入历史，可以说这些美术字的理念与西方的<span class="checkme">「几何化、特征极端化」</span>几无区别。而在八九十年代，中国也曾出现过像 Emigre 那样的解构主义排版。也就是说，这不是「有无平行可能」，而是「历史上已经有过」。  
Han characters have seen plenty of new artistic and decorative styles during the period of the First and Second World Wars, especially in Shanghai. Shanghai was the heart of China at the time, both geographically and financially. This was also where colonial influence took hold, and we can draw a parallel between such character styles and the Western ideas of <span class="doublecheck">「几何化、特征极端化」</span>.  
During the 80s, China too had typography in the style of Deconstructivism, something that Emigre was known for. This implies that it is not an impossibility that such ideas arise from China, it has already been done before.

Roman：我想强调的是，解构主义设计不仅是如今的全球现象，还有古老的历史。西方世界或者拉丁字母都不能声称这是自己的东西。我觉得篆书看上去绝对比行楷要解构主义多了。拉丁字母经历了比中文更强烈的演化和迁移，大多数字母本身的意义都无所谓了。既然每个逻辑组成部分除了表音之外没有任何意义，那么就更容易把整套文字放在解构主义下看待，而如果是半表音半表意就没那么简单了。但不管是什么文字，都不能只遵循一条道路。没有整体的画面，你无法解构，而没有具体的意义，你也无法完全「书法化」。  
I would like to emphasise that deconstructive design is a phenomenon as global as it is ancient, that neither the West nor the Latin alphabet does possess any right to claim for itself. The seal script (篆书) looks much more deconstructive than the running script (行楷) will ever be. The Latin script is a result of transition and migration much more than the Chinese writing system, making the meaning of most letters arbitrary.  
It may be easier to put a full script under the wing of deconstruction when the logical units do not mean anything but sounds, rather than if they are partly meaningful in terms of content. However, take any script you like, it is rarely desirable to exclusively follow one of these principles. You can not deconstruct without the greater image in mind, as little as you can fully “calligraphise” what could lose meaning.

**表音文字系统可能更容易受到全球化设计的影响，有一些突破和创新。那么亚洲文字，尤其是中文有多大的创新机会呢？**  
Writing systems that use phonograms seem to be more easily influenced by global design trends, sparking more breakthroughs and innovation. For Asian writing systems, especially Chinese, where are our opportunities for such innovation?

CP：西方设计师有不少也在设计一些东亚文字，但做中文设计还是很困难的，我们要更多地和国外接触联系，不断获得启发和帮助。比如，在字体匹配上，西方设计师会有自己的观点，我们做西文字体匹配也要考虑他们的眼光和判断，这一交流过程很关键。另外西方有一些市场和机会，比如有一些跨国企业需要采购多语言字体，他们的业务也会需要用到汉字。有一些功成名就的字体设计师已经有非常庞大的字体家族，而这些年也一直在扩大这些家族，多字重有了，其他多文字有了，就缺中文。然而中文又是那么大的市场，一旦有了中文字体之后，整个字体家族会比国内厂商做的一款字体强大得多，因为它已经有那么强大的多文字基础，匹配是无缝衔接的，产品竞争力上也更强。  
There are quite a number of Western designers who are working on East Asian scripts, but designing Chinese typefaces is still a challenge. We need to have greater collaboration with foreign countries, and continue to receive inspiration and support.  
For example, when we pair typefaces, Western designers will have their perspectives, so we should consider their tastes and perceptions when making such choices. This process of collaboration is rather crucial. Western markets also present opportunities, especially for international businesses, who need to commission typefaces for multiple languages, and they would require Han characters as well.  
Some of the designers from big name type foundries have already developed comprehensive font families and are constantly expanding them, with different styles and weights, even additional glyph support for multiple scripts. Except Chinese.  
The Chinese market is huge though, so once these font families support Chinese characters as well, the entire font family would become far more powerful than whatever our local type foundries can come up with, simply because they are fundamentally multilingual in nature. In thst sense, pairing typefaces becomes a seamless experience, making these super font families much more competitive on the market.

Mira：蒙纳的「翔鹤黑」就是具有这样的野心。  
Monotype's XiangHe Hei is attempting to do just that.

CP：我们也可以向西方借鉴项目管理上的经验，得到设计流程、工作方式、多人协作等全方位的启发，我们可以学到很多东西，而不是闭门造车。  
We can also learn from the West and their experience of managing projects of this scale, from the design process, methods of production, organisation of teams and different roles and so on. There is much we can learn, and we should not do this in isolation.

Peiran：其实我觉得机会仍然很大。也不是说一旦中文搞形态创新，就只能落到「不切实际的美术字／标题字」的圈套里。西文内文字的创新虽然丰富，但仍然是基于某种民众广泛接受的、字母形态的原型（archetype）下去创新，比如纵横比例、细部处理、笔画粗细对比等等。中文有没有这样的基本原型？我想是有的，这种原型甚至可以让中文脱离「需要搭配外来文字」这样的语境，自律性地往前发展。我们甚至还可以推测，说不定这样的创新已经不断在发生，只不过因为中文开发前期成本太高了，让这些创新出来的速度变慢、一般用户没有那么快看见而已。举个例子，如果说中文黑体的市场趋近饱和，那么说说宋体，至少在方正新书宋那样的四平八稳、以及空明朝那样的风味古郁之间，肯定是还有发挥空间的吧？再比如，怎么把仿宋体发展成更适合广泛使用的多字重大家族，到现在还是一个没有很好解决的问题。当然，可供创新的区域远远不止上面提的这两个例子，而推动这些创新（无论是自律性还是他律性）的元素也需要时间去跟上。除了笔画部件复用、多母版（Multiple Master）和插值变换（interpolation）等之外，还会不会发生其他生产方式上的重大变革？中文使用者的市场本身对于这些创新又会持什么样的态度？西文的字体消费市场那样转瞬即逝的字体潮流，有没有可能也会发生在中文身上？这些都是值得探索、可供创新的地方。  
I feel that there are lots of opportunities available. I do not think that innovation in Chinese typeface design is limited to just decorative styles or display typefaces. Typefaces for body copy for Latin-based scripts are plenty innovative, and still widely accepted by the public as they stem from the letterform's archetypes. For example, the proportions of each letterform, how narrow width strokes are handled, stroke widths and so on. Does Chinese not have such fundamental principles?  
I think we do. This would allow Chinese to shed the perception that any innovation has to complement foreign scripts, and move forward on its own. We can even posit that such innovation is already taking place, but because the time for developing Chinese typefaces is rather lengthy, it take a longer time for them to become known and visible.  
For example, if we say that HeiTi typefaces are reaching market saturation, then let's look at SongTi instead. Between the steady forms of Founder Type's “New Book Song (方正新书宋)” and the ancient flabour of Julius Hui's Aero Ming (空明朝), there is plenty of room for exploration. Or how about looking into how to develop FangSong into style that has wider applications by expanding it into a multi-weight super family? This is a long-standing issue that we have yet to solve.  
Of course, areas for innovation go way beyond the two examples described above, and the elements that contribute to pushing such innovation forward also need time to catch up. Other than stroke reuse, Multiple Master and interpolation, what other new methods of production will we see? How will these new ideas and methods be received by Chinese users? Will the fleeting trends often seen in the market for Latin-based typefaces also happen to Chinese typefaces? All these are topics worth exploring and have much potential for innovation.

---

从我们的讨论中不难感受到，强调以多元化、去中心化的视角了解在地文化和使用者习惯，是大家在谈论跨文化设计的审美问题时最大的共鸣；但反观自己的本土文化如何「被设计」，传统、创新、实验、异化的界限如何摸索，仍然是一个开放的问题。从这里出发，在设计实践中仍有太多的可能性：跨文化设计的需求多从双语／多语匹配出发，那么在文字匹配方面具体怎样实践上述审美观念？如何将理念转译为设计语言，又如何让设计语言影响使用者的具体感知？新的技术将为全球化的文字设计带来怎样的动力，又提出什么要求？我们将在之后的访谈中接着讨论这些话题。  
It is fairly obvious throughout this entire discussion that all the panelists are in agreement that focusing on the viewpoints of different cultures and understanding native speakers' behaviour and preferences as opposed to a centralised perspective is key for transcultural design aesthetics. Conversely, how our own cultures are being “designed”, the interplay between tradition, innovation and experimentation, is still an open question.  
There are many possibilities when it comes to the implementation of design, and the requirements for transcultural design stem mostly from bilingual or multilingual type pairings. Then how should we judge the aesthetics of such an implementation? How would we translate ideas into a concrete design language?  
And how would this design language impact the users themselves? We would also need to consider how new techniques and technologies inform the direction of typefaces which are used in increasingly international contexts, and what requirements they place on design as well. We will continue to explore these topics in further discussions to come.
